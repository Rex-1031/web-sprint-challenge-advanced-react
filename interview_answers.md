# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

     Simply put a stateful component is a component that handles changes in data also known as state. 
     A functional component will only pass props and display UI.  

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

    The componentWillMount function will be called before the mounting phase. 
    The componentWillUpdate function will be called just before new state or props are received. 

3. Define stateful logic.
    Code that uses state. 

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

    - **Arrange**: This is the setup phase of testing, where you indicate what specific items are being tested. 
    - **Act**: This is where the action happens, functions and methods are called here.   
    - **Assert**: In this phase test results are compared to test expectations that have been written.
